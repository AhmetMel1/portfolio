          Hello, I&apos;m Ahmet Melih Temiz. I studied Computer Programming at
          Istanbul University Cerrahpa≈üa and have always expanded my passion for
          technology through constant learning. Currently, I am a backend
          developer at Balance Network, working with technologies like Java,
          Spring Boot, Node.js, and Nest.js. My desire for continuous
          self-improvement and my ability to work in teams enable me to develop
          effective solutions, even in complex projects. I aim to contribute to
          the world of technology with innovative ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m open to Job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and
          grow. If you have a good opportunity that matches my skills and
          experience then don&apos;t hesitate to contact me.
